\section{Introduction}

\textit{Evolution strategies (ESs)} have been widely utilized to solve optimization problems where the true objective function evaluation is computationally-intensive. It is flexible and able to solve almost any optimization problems from two aspects, variation and selection. Firstly, by using a stochastic variation in generating new offspring, the landscape of the search space can be better explored and more new information can be potentially extracted that help generating better future offspring.   Secondly, search using a population of candidate solutions is more robust under moderate noise (the objective function value on a point may differ within a certain range) and multi-objective optimizations (objective functions with more than one optimum) compared with direct search methods like quasi-Newton. Then, applying a selection of the population can help make use of the information that is more helpful in solving the optimization problem. 

Various attempts have been made to reduce the cost by extracting the information obtained from points evaluated in previous iterations, such information yields insights into better selection and recombination that help generate potential promising offspring. One way is to use a surrogate model, an approximation model trained based on the candidate solutions evaluated by the true objective function in previous iterations. The surrogate model acts as a substitution of the true objective function that gives an inaccurate estimate of the objective function value at a much lower cost compared with using the exact objective function. Despite the computation saving of applying surrogate model, the estimated objective function value may contain a model bias and potentially affect the step size being adapted accordingly. Therefore, surrogate modeling can be helpful if the computational saving in using the true objective function outshines the potential poor step size resulted from the inaccurate surrogate estimation of the candidate solution. 

The history information could be used to construct a surrogate model. Some of the commonly used surrogate models include but are not limited to Polynomial Regression (PR, Response surface), Gaussian Process (GP, Kriging), neural networks and support vector machine (SVM), a comprehensive survey can be found by Jin \cite{JIN201161} and Loshchilov \cite{ECJ2016_LMCMA}.  The surrogate can acts as either a global approximation or a local approximation, referred to as a global or local surrogate. A global surrogate approximate the overall landscape of the objective function with less precision, which hopefully mimics the entire search space opposed to a local surrogate that approximate a much smaller region of the search space with more precision. Attempts have been made to use multiple surrogate models to assist EAs. One way is to construct a hierarchy, consisting first global surrogates that search the overall landscape and latter local surrogates doing a more thorough search \cite{8327940} \cite{zhou2007combining}. Since the computational saving is directly related to the quality of approximation i.e. the surrogate model quality, attempts have been made to construct online surrogates where the surrogate is adapted online. An online surrogate consists of a surrogate-adaptation mechanism \cite{loshchilov2012self} where the model quality is quantified, measured and updated whenever the quality is regarded poor by the mechanism. 

Those models tend to be sophisticated and heuristic in nature and the step behaviour of the algorithm are not always well interpreted. Comparison is often made by comparing the performance using the algorithm with and without model assistance where the behaviour of the surrogate is not well simulated. In this context, an approach simulating the surrogate can be helpful in understanding the surrogate behaviour, leading to potential modification to surrogate update or parameter-setting. Recent paper in surrogate assisted EAs by Kayhani and Arnold \cite{DBLP:conf/ppsn/KayhaniA18} analyze surrogate assisted (1+1)-ES on simple test functions where the surrogate is modeled using a noisy estimate of the true objective function and the step size behaviour is clear interpreted. As a natural sequence, we investigate the surrogate assisted $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES using the same surrogate model and following a similar analysis. Since the $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES generates a population of candidate solutions where the surrogate model can be potentially more fully exploited compared with the (1+1)-ES, it is interesting how much ES is to benefit from the surrogate and the resulting step behaviour as well as the model error would be affected.

This thesis intend to analyze and understand the surrogate-assisted $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES on simple test functions following the analysis of  surrogate model-assisted (1+1)-ES \cite{DBLP:conf/ppsn/KayhaniA18} and exploit the potential benefit of using an extensive sampling with surrogate model assistance. The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we give a brief review of related background and previous analysis that is needed later, in Section 3 we present the experimental result of the proposed local surrogate model-assisted $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES and study its behaviour on sphere functions. Based on the result, in Section 4, we first apply the well established cumulative step size adaptation (CSA) to the algorithm and present the result. Given the experimental result, we modify CSA and propose a step size adaptation mechanism with emergency where the step size is appropriately adapted and the performance on several test functions are recorded. The experimental result is followed by a discussion and future work in Section 5. 



% One way is to use the cumulative step size adaptation (CSA) \cite{Ostermeier:1994:DAS:1326675.1326679} that builds an evolution path based on the history step size (mutation) of ESs, the population in the next iteration is generated based on the mutation adapted by the evolution path. 

% , referred either as a local approximation or a global approximation to the true objective function \cite{Jin:2002:FAE:2955491.2955686}. There are a range of surrogate models and a survey of the development can be found by Jin \cite{JIN201161} and Loshchilov \cite{ECJ2016_LMCMA}. Those algorithms are usually heuristic by nature and the behaviour of each step is likely not well interpreted. Recent work in surrogate assisted EAs tend to use sophisticated algorithm where surrogates are combined or the model is updated online according to some heuristic. Comparison is often made by comparing the performance using the algorithm with and without model assistance where the behaviour of the surrogate is not well simulated. In this context, an approach that could simulate the surrogate would be helpful in understanding the surrogate behaviour, leading to potential modification for surrogate update or parameter-setting. A surrogate that models the objective function with desired precise gains benefit especially for algorithms that requires a large population size for good performance.The computational saving largely lies in the saved evaluations outshine the potential poor step resulted from relative inaccurate estimation of candidate solutions.

\section{Related Work}
\subsection{Evolution Strategies}

Evolution strategies (ESs), an category of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), is a nature-inspired direct search method that address optimization problems by using stochastic variation and selection. In each iteration, new offspring are generated from the parental population by mutation, followed by a selection based on the fitness of the offspring. Offspring selected as refereed to as the parental population for the next iteration. 

ES are commonly used in black-box optimization where the $N$-dimensional search space $\mathbb{R}^N$ is continuous, whereas the solution space $\mathbb{R}$ is 1-dimensional. We consider minimization of an objective function $f:\mathbb{R}^N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ maps the search space to the solution space i.e. maps a point (individual) in the search space to a value (its fitness) in the solution space. Despite the objective function being continuous, there is no assumption on the objective function, such optimization problem are referred to as black box optimization. 

\subsubsection{$(\mu/\rho\overset{+}{,}\lambda)-ES$}\label{sssec:def_ES}\hfill

A general ES can be defined as follows. Assume a parental population with size $\mu$, number of parent for recombination (in offspring generation) $\rho$ and the number of offspring generated in each iteration $\lambda$, where $\mu,\rho,\lambda$ are positive integers with $\rho \leq \mu$. Plus- or comma-selection ($\overset{+}{,}$) refers to how the parental population is updated. If a plus-selection is applied, only the best $\mu$ individuals are chosen considering both the parental population and the offspring generated in this iteration (i.e. totally $\mu+\lambda$ individuals are considered for selection). Whereas a comma-selection only chooses the offspring to update the parental population, no individual from previous parental population can be chosen (i.e. only $\lambda$ individuals are considered for selection).    

After selection, recombination is performed, meaning the selected individuals are recombined to generate the new offspring in next iteration. There are two common recombination approaches, intermediate recombination and weight recombination. Weighted recombination simply takes the average of all selected individuals as the recombined parent, while weighted recombination uses a weighted average of all selected individuals where the weight is normalized and depends on individual's fitness ranking. We denote the parental population $X = \{x_1,x_2,...,x_\mu\}$ and offspring generated in this iteration $Y = \{y_1,y_2,...,y_{\lambda} \}$ where $x_i,y_j \in \mathbb{R}^N$ for $i=1,...,\mu$ and $j=1,...,\lambda$. When generating one offspring, a standard normally distributed mutation vector $z_i \in \mathbb{R}^N $ is generated and added to the recombined parent with a step size parameter $\sigma \in \mathbb{R}$.  

Suppose we use a comma-selection with intermediate recombination, in each iteration, we take the average of $\rho$ individual randomly selected from the parental population $X$ as the recombined parent $x = 1/\rho \sum_{i=1}^{\rho}x_i$ where $x_i,x_j \in X, x_i \neq x_j$ and the offspring population $Y = \{y_j: 1 \leq j \leq \lambda\}$ is generated by  $y_j = x + \sigma z_j$, $1 \leq j \leq \lambda$.The offspring population is ranked according to each individual's fitness and the parent population is updated (replaced) by $X = \{ y_{i;\lambda}:1 \leq i \leq \mu \}$ where $f(y_{i;\lambda}) \leq f(y_{j,\lambda}), 1 \leq i < j \leq \lambda$. Consider plus-selection using weighted recombination, in each iteration, a recombined parent is obtained by taking a weighted average of the selected individuals (both parent of previous iteration and offspring generated in this iteration are considered). Suppose the parent population in timestamp $t$ (iteration) $X^{(t)}$ and offspring population generated in this iteration $Y^{(t)}$, the best $\mu$ individuals $x \prime_{i;\lambda+\mu} \in X^{(t)} \cup Y^{(t)},\  1 \leq i \leq \mu$ are selected with $ x \prime_{i;\lambda+\mu} \leq x \prime_{j;\lambda+\mu}, 1 \leq i < j \leq \lambda+\mu $ refereed to as the parental population for the next iteration $X^{(t+1)}$. The recombined parent at timestamp $t+1$ is obtained by randomly choosing $\mu$ individuals from $X^{(t+1)}$ that follows $x = 1/\rho \sum_{i=1}^{\rho} w_i x \prime _i$ where $w_i, 1 \leq i \leq \rho$ is a normalized weight directly related to offspring's fitness rank with $0 < w_i < w_j < 1$ for $f(x_i) < f(x_j),1 \leq i < j  \leq \rho$ and $\sum_{i=1}^\rho w_i = 1$.

\subsubsection{Step size adaptation}\label{sssec:step_size_adaptation}\hfill
\paragraph{The 1/5th Success Rule} 
The 1/5th success rule is a basic step size control for ES. The step size is adapted according to the success rate of generating a good offspring i.e. an offspring $y$ with $f(y)<f(x)$. If the success rate is lower than 1/5, the step size is decreased, otherwise increased. The 1/5 is chosen by Rechenberg \cite{Rechenberg1973} after obtaining the optimal success rate (i.e. achieving the largest fitness gain per iteration) for orridor function and quadratic sphere function to be $\approx 0.184$ and $\approx 0.270$ respectively for $n \rightarrow \infty$.  
\paragraph{Cumulative Step-Size Adaptation} 
The step size of $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES is commonly adapated using cumulative step size adaptation (CSA) proposed by Ostermeier et al \cite{Ostermeier:1994:DAS:1326675.1326679}. In each iteration, $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES generate $\lambda$ candidate solutions $y_i \in \mathbb{R}^N,i=1,...,\lambda$ from a parental population $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^N i=1,...,\mu$ and the centroid of the parent population is $x = 1/\mu \sum_{i=1}^\mu x_i$, where $\mu < \lambda$. The parental population is replaced by the best $\mu$ candidate solutions gennerated by $y_i = x + \sigma z$ where $\sigma \in \mathbb{R}$ is a scalar referred to as the step size and $z \in \mathbb{R}^N$ as the mutation. For a strategy with ideally adapted step size, each step should be uncorrelated. If the connective are negatively correlated, the step size should be decreased. In contrast, if the connective steps are positively correlated, meaning the steps are pointing to the same direction. Then a number of small steps can be replaced by fewer large steps and therefore, the step size should increase. 

To decide the correlation, information from previous steps and mutations are cumulated. By comparing the step size with its expected length under random selection, the step size is adapted according to its expected length. Step size increases if the length is less than expected and decrease otherwise. 

Define the search path as 
\begin{align}
p_{k+1} \leftarrow (1-c)p_k + \sqrt{\mu c (2-c)} z,
\end{align}
where $0<c \geq 1$ is the proportion of history information retained and passed to the evolution path in the next iteration, $ \sqrt{\mu c (2-c)}$ is a normalization constant that updates the evolution path from the mutation of this iteration and $z$, the mutation obtained by averaging the best $\mu$ candidate solutions generated. 

The step size is adapted 
\begin{align}
\sigma \leftarrow \sigma \exp \left (  \frac{c}{d}  \left( \frac{\Vert p\Vert}{E \Vert N(O,I)\Vert } \right) \right ),
\end{align}
where $E\| N(0,I) \|$ is the expected length of the search path $p$ that can be approximated as $E\| N(0,I) \| \approx \sqrt{n} (1-1/4n + 1/21n^2)$. In section 4, we use the well established parameters for CSA from  Hansen \cite{hansen2016cma} that follows 
\begin{align}
\begin{cases}
c = (\mu+2)/(N+\mu+5)\\
d=1+2 \max\left (0, \sqrt{(\mu-1)/(N+1)-1} \right)+c.
\end{cases}
\end{align}


\subsubsection{Analyzing ES}\label{sssec:analysis_sphere_combined}\hfill

To understand the behaviour EAs, we first introduce analyzing ES on simple test functions where the step behaviour of the algorithm are more likely to be understood. Then proceed to the analysis on noisy sphere where the same analysis can be used to model the surrogate assisted $(\mu/\mu.\lambda)$-ES. Specifically, the $(\mu/\mu.\lambda)$-ES is first analyzed on quadratic sphere and then noisy sphere that models the ideal performance of surrogate model assisted $(\mu/\mu.\lambda)$-ES.    

 \paragraph{On Sphere Function}

% Formulation of problem
Consider the minimization of the quadratic sphere $f: \mathbb R^N \rightarrow \mathbb R$ with $f(x)=x^Tx$ where $(\mu/\mu.\lambda)$-ES is applied. In each iteration, $\lambda$ offspring $y_i \in \mathbb{R}^N,i = 1,...,\lambda $ are generated from the parental population $X$ with size $ \left| X \right| = \mu$ and the offspring population denoted as $Y$ has size $\left| Y \right| =\lambda$, each individual in the parental population follows $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^N, i=1,...,\mu$, where $\lambda>\mu$. Since $(\mu/\mu.\lambda)$-ES is the case where $\rho = \mu$ and uses comma-selection, the selection is based solely on the offspring population $Y$ i.e. the old parental population $X$ dies out and is replaced by the best $\mu$ candidate solutions $y_{i;\lambda},i = 1,2,...,\mu$ evaluated by the objective function with fitness $f(y_{i;\lambda}) \leq f(y_{j,\lambda}), 1 \leq i < j \leq \lambda$. Each  offspring is generated by $y_i = x + \sigma z$, where the recombined parent $x = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i/\mu$ also the centroid of the parental population $X$ is obtained through intermediate recombination discussed in Section \ref{sssec:def_ES}, $z \in  \mathbb R^N$ is a standard normally distributed random vector, $\sigma > 0$ is the step size of the strategy, the adaptation using CSA in this context has been described in previous Section \ref{sssec:step_size_adaptation}. 

% The expected fitness gain over noise-to-signal ratio
Decomposition of $z$, first proposed by Rechenberg \cite{rechenberg1973evolutionsstrategie} can be used to study the expected step size of the strategy. We can decompose the vector $z$ as a vector sum $z = z_1 + z_2$, where $z_1$ is in the direction of the negative gradient of the objective function $\nabla f(x)$, while $z_2$ orthogonal to $z_1$. We have $z_1$ standard normally distributed, while $\Vert z_2\Vert^2$ $\chi$-distributed with $N-1$ degree of freedom and $ \Vert z_2\Vert^2 /N \overset{N \rightarrow \infty }{=} 0$ (see reference theorem [$\color{red}{dirk's\ slides }$]). Denote $\delta = N (f(x) - f(y))/(2R^2)$, where $R = \Vert x \Vert$ is the distance to the optimal, we further introduce normalized step size $\sigma^* = N \sigma/R$ and $z_{\text{step}} = \sum_{i=1}^\mu z_{i;\lambda}$ (the averaged $z$ taken by the best $mu$ candidate solutions). The normalized fitness advantage of $y$ over $x$ follows
\begin{align}{}
\delta & = \frac{N}{2R^2}\left( f(x) - f(y)\right)  \nonumber\\
& = \frac{N}{2R^2} (x^Tx - (x+\sigma z_{\text{step}})^T (x+\sigma z_{\text{step}})) \nonumber\\
& = \frac{N}{2R^2} (-2 \sigma x^Tz_{\text{step}} - \sigma^2 \Vert z_{\text{step}}\Vert^2 ) \nonumber\\
& \overset{N \rightarrow \infty}{=} \sigma^* z_{\text{step},1} - \frac{{\sigma^*} ^2}{2} \label{eqn:delta}{},
\end{align}
where $z_{\text{step},1} $, the component of $z_{\text{step}}$ pointing to the negative graident of $f(x)$, is normally distributed and $\overset{ N \rightarrow \infty}{=}$ denotes the convergence of the distribution $\Vert z_{\text{step} } \Vert^N/N = 1$. 

 \paragraph{On Noisy Sphere Function}
The sphere is considered noisy when the fitness evaluation is inaccurate and the objective function on a fixed point may vary in a certain range in different objective function calls. The following uses the analysis and modeling proposed by Arnold and Bayer \cite{ARNOLD2001127}. 

The objective function value on noisy sphere can be modeled by adding a Gaussian random variable with mean equals the true objective function value and some variance referred to as noise strength $\sigma_\epsilon$. The noisy estimate of a candidate solution $x$ follows $f_{\epsilon}(x) = f(x) + \sigma_{\epsilon}z_\epsilon$ where $z_\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ is a standard normally distributed random variable that randomize the noise generated. By further introduces $\sigma_\epsilon^* = N \sigma_\epsilon / (2R^2)$, the normalized fitness noise \cite{1284729} and replace the accurate objective function evaluation with the noisy estimate, the normalized fitness advantage of $y$ on noisy sphere when $n \rightarrow \infty$ in Eqn. (\ref{eqn:delta}) is
\begin{align}
\delta_\epsilon &=  \frac{N}{2R^2}\left( f_\epsilon (x) - f_\epsilon(y)\right)  \nonumber\\ 
& = \frac{N}{2R^2} (x^Tx - (x+\sigma z_{\text{step}})^T (x+\sigma z_{\text{step}}) +\sigma_{x,\epsilon} z_{x,\epsilon}-\sigma_{y,\epsilon} z_{y,\epsilon}) \nonumber\\
& = \frac{N}{2R^2} (-2 \sigma x^Tz_{\text{step}} - \sigma^2 \Vert z_{\text{step}}\Vert^2 +\sigma_\epsilon z_\epsilon) \nonumber\\
&\overset{N \rightarrow \infty}{=} \delta+\sigma_\epsilon^* z_\epsilon, \label{eqn:delta_noise}{}
\end{align}
the term $\sigma_{x,\epsilon} z_{x,\epsilon},\sigma_{y,\epsilon} z_{y,\epsilon}$ denote the added noise for the recombined parent $x$ and the offspring $y$ respectively and w.l.o.g. $\sigma_{x,\epsilon} z_{x,\epsilon},\sigma_{y,\epsilon} z_{y,\epsilon}$ can be viewed as a vector sum denoted as $\sigma_\epsilon z_\epsilon$. By substituting the noise term, we get the simplified Eqn. (\ref{eqn:delta_noise}).

The expected value of the normalized change in objective function value  
\begin{align}
\Delta &= -\frac{N}{2} E \left [  \log f_\epsilon(y) - \log {f_\epsilon(x)} \right ] \nonumber\\
 &= -\frac{N}{2} E \left [  \log \frac{f_\epsilon(x^{(t+1)})}{f_\epsilon(x^{(t)})} \right ], 
\end{align}
where $x^{(t)}$ is the centroid of parental population (recombined parent) in timestamp $t$, the equation is normalized in terms of dimensionality.

In each iteration, $\lambda$ offspring are evaluated, the objective function evaluation per iteration is $\lambda$ (for $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES), therefore the normalized progress rate when dimensionality $N \rightarrow \infty$ is equation (7) from \cite{ARNOLD2001127} 
\begin{align}\label{eqn:eta_noise_sphere}{}
\eta = \frac{1}{\lambda}E[ \Delta] \approx \frac{1}{\lambda} \left( \frac{\sigma^* c_{\mu / \mu, \lambda}}{\sqrt {1+ \vartheta^2}} - \frac{(\sigma^*)^2}{2 \mu} \right),
\end{align}
where $\vartheta = \sigma_\epsilon^*/\sigma^*$ is the noise-to-signal ratio, defined to measure the noise level relative to the algorithm's step size, $c_{\mu/\mu,\lambda}$ is the $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-progress coefficient derived by Arnold and Beyer \cite{Arnold:2000:EMS:645825.669117} that follows
% $\color{red}{paper\ missing}$
\begin{align}\label{eqn:c_mu_mu_lambda}
c_{\mu/\mu,\lambda}  = \frac{\lambda-\mu}{2 \pi} \begin{pmatrix} \lambda \\ \mu \end{pmatrix} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2}   \left [ \Phi(x)\right]^{\lambda-\mu-1}  \left[ 1- \Phi (x) \right]^{\mu-1}  \text{d} x,
\end{align}
where $\Phi^{-1}$ is the inverse function of $\Phi$, the normal cumulative distribution function. The integral can be solved numerically.  



\subsection{Surrogate Model} 

Surrogate model is a computational model constructed based on the data evaluated using true objective function. The surrogate acts as am approximation to the true objective function that is costly in most cases, so that the objective function estimation using the surrogate model although inaccurate can be achieved at vanishing cost. 

The surrogate model can be applied to EAs as an approximate fitness to accelerate the evolution process \cite{Ratle:1998:ACE:645824.668750}. Despite the computational saving when using a surrogate model, issues can occur when the surrogate built leads to a false optima (i.e. the optima does not exist in the true objective function). This can  leads to potential divergence and unstable optimization path where the convergence property of the ES may not be well preserved.   

One remedy in prevention of the false optima introduced by the surrogate model is to use surrogate model management that controls the choice of evaluation between true objective function and the surrogate model. According to Jin \cite{Jin:2005:CSF:1039803.1039805}, surrogate model management can be divided into three categories, namely, individual-based, generation-based, and population-based. 

\subsubsection{Individual-based}

In individual-based surrogate, some of the individuals within a generation are evaluated using the surrogate model. Others using the true objective function.



\subsubsection{Generation-based }

The surrogate model evaluates all the offspring in some of the generations. Offspring in other generations are eventuated using the true objective function.


\subsubsection{Population-based}

The population is divided into some subpopulations where each subpopulation has its own surrogate model. The surrogate model only evaluates the offspring generated in the population it belongs to.    



Two approaches will be discussed. The first one uses an individual-based surrogate where a fraction of individuals in the generation is evaluated depending on the surrogate model error 

Another approach proposed by Kern et al. updates the surrogate model iff. the best point evaluated by the model is the same before and after adding one extra training point.

Surrogate is used in recombination

% \subsubsection{Surrogate model adapted online}



% % Def of surrogate model 

% Using an approximate model to reduce computational cost can be traced back to 1960s \cite{dunham1963design}. Some successful surrogated models include but are not limited to Polynomial Regression (PR, response surface methodology) \cite{doi:10.1080/00401706.1966.10490404}, Gaussian Process (GP, Kriging models) \cite{sacks1989}, Artificial neural networks \cite{Smith:1993:NNS:583180}. There are two types of surrogate models, global surrogate model and local surrogate model, . ES using global surrogate model based on Kring was examined by Ratle \cite{Ratle:2001:KSF:966173.966177}. Another ES using global surrogate model based on Artificial neural networks was constructed by Jin \cite{Jin02aframework} which gives an imperial criterion on using the true objective function or the surrogate model to evaluate the offspring. Ulmer et al \cite{Ulmer03evolutionstrategies} and Buche et al \cite{1424193} also applied GP as surrogate models in ES. But the performance of global surrogate models degrade as the dimension of the data increases, known as \textit{curse of dimensionality}. Since the performance of ES is straightly affected by the surrogate model accuracy, online surrogates has been introduced by using a surrogate-adaptation mechanism that updated the model according to some heuristic. Loshchilov et al \cite{loshchilov2012self} uses .
% Online local surrogate models \cite{4033013} can be constructed using methods like radial basis function (RBF) \cite{GIANNAKOGLOU200243} to replace the global surrogate model, where the surrogate model is updated online, giving a more accurate estimation compared with the global surrogate model.


%comparision based surrogate

%surroagte-assisted


% Recent works in surrogated assisted EAs uses a combination of different surrogate models to estimate the fitness strength of the candidate solutions. Zhou et al \cite{4033013} proposed a hierarchical surrogate-assisted ES where a global surrogate model and a local surrogate model are integrated. The Global surrogate model uses GP and PR to estimate the global fitness of ES's search space, filtering the unpromising candidate solutions. Then, a local surrogate-assisted Lamarckian learning based on RBF is performed to search the promising candidate solutions. 


% There are various surrogate-assisted EAs integrating global and local surrogate models or using a combination of heuristics. These methods tend to be sophisticated for good performance, while few literatures have $\color{red}{systematically\ investigated ???}$ the surrogated-assisted $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES. One exception is what Chen and Zou \cite{10.1007/978-3-319-09333-8_4} proposed but yet incomplete in terms of two aspects. Firstly, it uses a linear surrogate that cannot give a precise estimate when coordinate transform is applied, the precondition to solve a generalized optimization problem \cite{DBLP:conf/ppsn/KayhaniA18}. Secondly, it does not include a step size adaptation mechanism. Besides that, Ulmer et al \cite{Ulmer2005} proposed a Model Assisted Steady-State Evolution Strategy (MASS-ES), which is a ($\mu+\lambda$)-ES that is a (1+1)-ES when we set $\mu=\lambda=1$. But the behavior of step size adaptation is unclear given the proposed conditions.


% % (mml)-ES with surrogate model 
% % much on CMA-ES less on CSA


% $\color{red}{\text{wonder should focus more on } surrogate assisted (1+1)-ES or surrogate assisted mml-ES, possibliy most CMA-ES}$

% % (1+1)-ES with surrogate model 
% There is a wealth of literatures for solving black box optimization using (1+1)-ES on unimodal test problems given the convergence property of convex functions. Kayhani and Arnold \cite{DBLP:conf/ppsn/KayhaniA18} proposed a surrogated-assisted (1+1)-ES that investigates the acceleration and single step behaviour of the algorithm using GP based local surrogate. In this algorithm, the local surrogate acts as a filter and is updated every time when a true objective function is made. Since (1+1)-ES generate a single offspring per iteration and is not as robust as $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$ especially in the presence of surrogate (bias due to choice of points), we argue that it is natural to ask to what degree the choice of population can benefit the ES in terms of robustness and acceleration.
% , and how the step size could be successfully adapted.  

% local surrogate model filters the undesired candidate solutions by comparing the fitness between the parent evaluated by true objective function and a sigle offspring evaluated by GP in each iteration. One candidate solution is evaluated using the true objective function if and only if its fitness evaluated by GP is superior to its parent where the surroagate. The surrogate model is updated whenever a new true objective function call is made. The training set for GP is updated whenever one true objective function evaluation is made. 
% % The most recent offspring evaluated by true objective function is then added to the training set for Gaussian Process, replacing the oldest data point in the training set. 
% The proposed GP based local surrogate gives a 3-time-speed-up compared with the usual (1+1)-ES on quadratic sphere. We want to construct a similar GP based local surrogate model and compare the result using the same test functions and analysis.

\section{Analysis}\label{sec:analysis}

To understand the potential implications of using surrogate models in EAs with varying population size, in this section, we use a simple model for the use of a surrogate model. Specifically, we propose an EA that, in each iteration, a population of $\lambda$ offspring $Y$ are generated and then evaluated by the surrogate model instead of true objective function followed by a intermediate recombination based on the inaccurate surrogate estimate where a true objective function evaluation is made for the centroid of the selected offspring, referred to as the recombined parent $x$. Offspring generation is the same as is discussed in $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES. The major difference in analysis between $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES on noisy sphere and $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES with surrogate model assistance on sphere lies in the evaluation of recombined parent $x$ where the former applies a noisy estimate and the latter uses a true objective function call. Therefore, the normalized fitness advantage of $y$ over $x$ is
\begin{align}
\delta_\epsilon &=  \frac{N}{2R^2}\left( f(x) - f_\epsilon(y)\right)  \nonumber\\ 
& = \frac{N}{2R^2} (x^Tx - (x+\sigma z_{\text{step}})^T (x+\sigma z_{\text{step}}) -\sigma_{y,\epsilon} z_{y,\epsilon}) \nonumber\\
& = \frac{N}{2R^2} (-2 \sigma x^Tz_{\text{step}} - \sigma^2 \Vert z_{\text{step}}\Vert^2 +\sigma_\epsilon z_\epsilon) \nonumber\\
&\overset{N \rightarrow \infty}{=} \delta+\sigma_\epsilon^* z_\epsilon, \label{eqn:delta_surrogate}{}
\end{align}
where by changing variable, the noise term $-\sigma_{y,\epsilon} z_{y,\epsilon}$ can be replaced by $\sigma_\epsilon z_\epsilon$ that gives exactly the same result as Eqn. （\ref{eqn:delta_noise}). The analysis in Section \ref{sssec:analysis_sphere_combined} still holds. In this context, the noise-to-signal ratio $\vartheta$ can be interpreted as the measure of the surrogate model quality relative to step size of the algorithm. This analysis could be extend to biased surrogate models where the distribution mean is different from the exact objective function value\cite{DBLP:conf/ppsn/KayhaniA18}. 

Since the fitness of $\lambda$ offspring generated are evaluated by the surrogate model with vanishing cost. The objective function evaluation per iteration is 1 instead of $\lambda$ (for $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES without model assistance), therefore the normalized progress rate when dimensionality $N \rightarrow \infty$, by substituting $\lambda$ with 1 in Eqn. (\ref{eqn:eta_noise_sphere}), the normalized progress rate is 
\begin{align}\label{eqn:eta_surrogate}{}
\eta = \frac{1}{1}E[ \Delta] \approx  \frac{\sigma^* c_{\mu / \mu, \lambda}}{\sqrt {1+ \vartheta^2}} - \frac{(\sigma^*)^2}{2 \mu} ,
\end{align}
To obtain the opt. expected fitness gain $\eta_{opt}$ and its corresponding opt. normalized step size $\sigma^*_{opt}$, we take derivative of equation (\ref{eqn:eta_surrogate}) over $\sigma^*$ and get the following 
\begin{align}\label{eqn:opt_surrogate}
\sigma^*_{opt} &= \frac{ \mu c_{\mu / \mu, \lambda}}{\sqrt {1+ \vartheta^2}}\\
\eta_{opt} &= \frac{\sigma^*_{opt} c_{\mu / \mu, \lambda}}{\sqrt {1+ \vartheta^2}} - \frac{(\sigma^*_{opt})^2}{2 \mu} 
\end{align}

\end{center}

The expected fitness gain is normalized in terms of the population size $\lambda$ for easy comparison. The normalized fitness gain against the normalized step size for $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES with population size $\lambda=10,20,40$ corresponding $\mu=3,5,10$ are plotted in \ref{fig:expectedFitGain} from left to right respectively. The line shows the result obtained from Eqs. (\ref{eqn:eta_surrogate}) (\ref{eqn:c_mu_mu_lambda}). The dots represent the experimental result for unbiased Gaussian surrogate error for $n \in \{10,100 \}$ obtained by averaging 100 runs. The result obtained for $n \rightarrow \infty$ are considered to be cases with a large normalized step size with very small noise to signal ratio. 

It can be inferred from Fig. \ref{fig:expectedFitGain}, for a fixed population size, the expected fitness gain decreases with an increasing noise-to-signal-ratio. When $\vartheta \rightarrow \infty$, the surrogate model becomes useless and the strategy becomes a random search. For moderate noise-to-signal ratio $\vartheta$, the surrogate model assisted algorithm can achieve much larger value for expected fitness gain at a larger normalized step size. When $\vartheta = 1$, the maximal expected fitness gain achievable for $(3/3,10)$-ES,$(5/5,20)$-ES and $(10/10,40)$-ES are 0.8507, 1.841, 3.808 with $\sigma^*=2.254,4.251,8.738$ respectively. Compared with the result of the surrogate assisted (1+1)-ES \cite{DBLP:conf/ppsn/KayhaniA18} where maximal fitness gain is 0.548 achieved at $\sigma^* = 1.905$, $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES does benefit from using a larger population from the analysis. For $\vartheta=0$ (the surrogate models the objective function exactly), from equation (\ref{eqn:opt_surrogate}) we can obtain the maximal expected fitness gain is achieved at $\sigma^*_{opt} = \ \mu c_{\mu / \mu, \lambda}$ with value $\eta_{opt} =  \mu (c_{\mu / \mu, \lambda})^2/2$. Even if this indicates the potential benefit the strategy may gain with a growing population, it is important to note the analytical results derived when $n \rightarrow \infty$ is an approximation for the finite-dimensional case. Fig. \ref{fig:opt_stepSize_fitGain} shows the relation of optimal expected fitness gain and the corresponding optimal normalized step size over noise-to-signal ratio derived analytically in the limit of $n \rightarrow \infty$ for three different population sizes. The optimal expected fitness gain is also measured experimentally for $n \in \{10,100 \}$. 

The speed-up is the ratio of median number of objective function evaluations used for surrogate assisted (1+1)-ES divide by that of surrogate assisted $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES. For a finite-dimension, the speed-up achieved with surrogate model assistance for small noise-to-signal ratio with $n=10$ appears to be around one and two for a population size equals 10, two and three for $\lambda = 20$, four and five for $\lambda=40$ respectively. The speed-up of $n=100$ for each population size fall into almost the same range as is the case for $n=10$.  
$\color{red}{\text{Wonder if the speed up should be calculated as (1+1)-ES/mml-ES both with model assistance}}$ $ \color{red}{\text{and could it be reported in the table later as in each cell numOfObjFunCalls(speed-up)}}$

There is a significant speed-up following the analysis and it seems the expected fitness gain of surrogate assisted $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES will increase as the population size $\lambda$ grows.

Even though the analysis in Section \ref{sec:analysis} suggests a potential better performance for the surrogate-assisted $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES. There is no guarantee the step size of the strategy can be properly adapted and further the analysis is very inaccurate in terms of finite dimension. In this section we experiment the surrogate model assisted $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES using the cumulative step size adaptation described in Section \ref{sssec:step_size_adaptation} and exploit the potential insight it may offer. The strategy is evaluated by using a Gaussian Process based surrogate model replacing the simple model that simulates the surrogate behaviour in Section \ref{sec:analysis}. Several test functions are used for testing the strategy. 
One signle iteration fo the surrogate model assisted $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES using CSA is shown in Alg. \ref{alg:mml-es}. 

Five ten-dimensional test problems are used to test if the step size of the strategy has been appropriately adapted, namely sphere functions $f(x) = (x^Tx)^{\alpha/2}$ for $\alpha = \{1,2,3 \}$ referred to as linear, quadratic and cubic spheres, $f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n(\sum_{j=1}^i x_j)^2$ (i.e. a convex quadratic function with condition number of the Hessian approximately equal to 175.1) referred to as Schwefel's Problem 1.2 \cite{Schwefel:1981:NOC:539468}) and quartic function \cite{DBLP:conf/ppsn/KayhaniA18} defined as $f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \left[ \beta(x_{i+1} -x_i^2)^2 + (1-x_i)^2 \right]$ where $\beta = 1$. The quartic function becomes the Rosenbrock function when the condition number of the Hessian at the optimizer exceeds 3,500, making it very hard to find the global optima without adapting the shape of mutation distribution. We use the quartic function in the context with $\beta=1$  and condition number of the Hessian at the optimizer equals to 49.0. The value of global optima for all test functiosn is zero. For each test problem, 1000 runs are conducted both for surrogate assisted $(1+1)$-ES and surrogate assisted $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES where a parental population size $\lambda=10,20,40$ with $\mu = \lceil \lambda / 4 \rceil$ are used. For surrogate model, we use Gaussian process with squared exponential kernel and the length scale parameter in the kernel is set proportional to the square of the dimension and the step size of the ES. For simplicity, the length scale is set to $8 \sigma \sqrt{n}$.

The Gaussian process kernel is constructed using a training size of 40. The training set consists of the most recent 40 candidate solutions evaluated, so that the surrogate model approximates the local landscape of the objective function. All runs are initialized with starting point sampled from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit covariance matrix and initial step size $\sigma_0=1$. The termination criteria is defined as one solution achieves objective function value below $10^{-8}$.

Histogram showing the number of objective function calls needed to solve the test problems within the required accuracy are represented in the first row of Fig. \ref{fig:merged_plot}, the median objective function calls for each test problem is shown in Table \ref{Tab:Test_result}. The result by Kayhani and Arnold \cite{DBLP:conf/ppsn/KayhaniA18} using surrogate assisted (1+1)-ES is also included for comparison. The results of surrogate assisted $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES do not match the performance of surrogate assisted (1+1)-ES. The speed-up is defined as the median number of objective function evaluations used by the surrogate assisted (1+1)-ES \cite{DBLP:conf/ppsn/KayhaniA18} divided by the surrogate assisted $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES. Despite achieving a speed up between 1.2 and 1.9 for quartic function, the surrogate assisted $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES performs worse on sphere functions and even does not converge in Schwefel' s function. There is a trend in quadratic sphere and quartic function that the performance improves with a growing parental population, the number of objective function evaluations needed to solve linear sphere even increases after $\lambda>20$.

\begin{figure*}

\caption{Result obtained by adapting step size using CSA. The first two rows show the normalized convergence rate for each run plotted in histogram and normalized probability density function (pdf) respectively. The last two rows represent the success rate (proportion of good step size in each run) plotted in histogram and pdf respectively.}
\label{fig:success_convergence_plot}
\end{figure*}
\end{center}
The second row of Fig. \ref{fig:merged_plot} shows th convergence graphs observed in median runs. Linear convergence are achieved for all test functions despite the Schwefel's function using surrogate assisted $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES, interestingly, using a larger population does not help achieve a better convergence rate, but instead,  makes the strategy diverge. Relative model error for the median runs is shown in the third row of the figure, defined as $\|f(y)-f_{\epsilon}(y) \|/\|f(y)-f_(x) \|$ where $x$ is the parent and $y$ the offspring candidate solution for (1+1)-ES and $\text{var}(f(y)-f_\epsilon(y))/\text{var}(f(y))$, the variance of the difference between the surrogate estimate of $\lambda$ candidate solutions and their true objective function values dvided by the variance of the true objective function values of $\lambda$ candidate solutions for $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES. The relative model error is smoothed logarithmically by convolution with a Gaussian kernel with window size 40 that is represented as the bold line in the centre of the plots (denoted [S] in the Fig.). This can be interpreted as the a relative constant noise-to-signal ratio. The relative model error for all surrogate assisted ES in this context is approximately 1 and according to the analysis in Section 3 should give a much larger speed up especially given a larger population. This may give indication that the step size is not appropriately adapted. The bottom row shows the normalized step size $\sigma^* = N \sigma/R$ for three sphere functions, where $N$,$R$ are the dimension of data and distance to optimal respectively is the dimension. It coincides with the knowledge that using a population in offspring generation is possible for larger step size but the potential improvement is still yet clear. 

There is a big gap between the analytical result obtained in Section 3 and the experimental result shown above. The relation between the expected fitness gain and population size is not yet clear. To better understand the relation, we plot the histogram and probability density function (pdf) for success rate (for a good step size) and normalized convergence rate for linear, quadratic and cubic sphere functions in Fig. \ref{fig:success_convergence_plot}. The normalized convergence rate are defined as follows 

\begin{align}
c = 
\begin{cases}
- n \left[ \log \left( \frac{f(x_{t+1})}{f(x_t)} \right)\right],& \text{linear sphere} \\
 - \frac{n}{2} \left[ \log \left( \frac{f(x_{t+1})}{f(x_t)} \right)\right],& \text{quadratic sphere} \\
- \frac{n}{3} \left[ \log \left( \frac{f(x_{t+1})}{f(x_t)} \right)\right],& \text{cubic sphere}.
\end{cases}
\end{align}

Histograms showing the normalized convergence rate for all runs are shown in the top row of Fig. \ref{fig:success_convergence_plot}, followed by its probability density function (pdf) in row 2. The last two rows in Fig. \ref{fig:success_convergence_plot} shows the success rate plotted in histogram and pdf for all runs. Despite the relative large success rate for a good step size, the $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES with model assistance has a lower normalized convergence rate compared with (1+1)-ES with model assistance. In linear sphere, the normalized convergence rate between 0.2 for and 0.3 compared with 0.4 for (1+1)-ES partially explains the relative poor performance. Both success rate and normalized convergence rate for $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES do not vary much in terms of population size. It is interesting that the probability of a good step size for surrogate assisted $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES is approximately 0.5, indicating the strategy makes a bad step every other step.  



% Firstly, the step size is not appropriately adapted using CSA. The bias of the Gaussian process surrogate can be another problem and we will discuss these further in future work.

Given a success rate approximately 0.48 for all population size in all sphere functions. It comes natural to ask, how much we are to benefit if we can avoid or simply reject those bad steps. Recent papers in surrogate model assisted ES consider (1+1)-ES \cite{DBLP:conf/ppsn/KayhaniA18}, the step size of the strategy is successfully adapted based on the success rate of a good step size. The step size decreases if the estimated fitness of the offspring is inferior to the true fitness of its parent or the true fitness of the offspring evaluated is inferior to that of its parent. Applying a similar idea, we propose step size adaptation mechanism for the surrogate assisted $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES based on CSA that handles emergency. We define the emergency situation as an offspring generated is inferior to its parent, meaning the step size generated in this iteration is bad. Given the emergency, we decrease the step size by a factor of 0.72. The proposed step size adaptation using CSA with emergency is shown in Alg. \ref{alg:CSA_with_emergency} by adding a conditional statement comparing the fitness of the offspring obtained with its parent as is illustrated in line 15 Alg. \ref{alg:CSA_with_emergency}. In each timestamp, one offspring (the centroid of the $\lambda$ ) is evaluated using the true objective function and its fitness is compared to its parent. If the fitness of the offspring is inferior to its parent, indicating the step size made is poor, the offspring is discarded and the step size is decreased. The bad step size is not added to the evolution path since we want to build an evolution path based on the good step information of previous iterations.

To test the proposed the step size adaptation mechanism, we use same test functions and generate corresponding plots from Section 4.1. The number of objective function evaluations in median runs and the corresponding speed-up is represented in Table \ref{Tab:Test_result_emergency}. The performance of surrogate assisted $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES improves as the population size increases, which is as expected. For a population size of $40$, the speed up for sphere functions are 1.6, 1.5 and 1.2 for linear, quadratic and cubic respectively. It is notable that the speed-ups in linear sphere are between twice and three times before the emergency situation is proposed. For Schwefel' s function and quartic function, the strategy obtain a convergence rate of 0.35 and 0.5 respectively for a population size from 10 to 20 with 0.3 for both test functions for a population size from 20 to 40. This is well illustrated in the histogram of objective function calls in first row of Fig. \ref{fig:merged_plot_emergency} that the objective function calls for all functions reduces with a growing population size. The convergence graphs  in the second show that linear convergence is achieved for all strategies for all test functions. The third row shows the relative model error for the median runs described in Section 4.1, it is interesting that the relative model error for surrogate assisted $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES with different population size is actually higher after the step size is adapted using the CSA with emergency, previous result in Section 3.1 shows (1+1)-ES with model assistance has higher relative model error, but the value is really close after using the new step size adaptation. The last row in Fig. \ref{fig:merged_plot_emergency} shows the normalized step size, where the benefit of $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES is no longer obvious given the fact that we discard the inferior offspring, but it can be inferred that using a larger population size could reduce the variance in normalized step size.
$\color{red}{\text{will add more accurate data for comparison, including the range of GP error}}$    

Histogram and probablity density function of normalized convergence rate and success rate are plotted in Fig. \ref{fig:success_convergence_emergency}. The convergence rate for all population size grows significantly, almost doubled for all test functions despite a slight decrease in success rate (can also be interpreted as one minus the rate when emergency happens). It makes sense that the CSA with emergency rejects bad steps so that the quality of each step taken improves and therefore larger normalized convergence rate. Using CSA with emergency with a large population suggests an improvement in normalized convergence rate but a slight decrease in success rate for sphere functions. There is a trade-off between the two and finding the optimal relation can be a future goal to work on.

\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we used unbiased Gaussian distributed noise to model the surrogate model's hebaviour. By using this approach, we analyzed the behaviour of surrogate model assisted $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES on quadratic sphere functions. Based on the analysis and the observation using cumulative step size adaptation, we proposed a step size adaptation mechanism in terms of emergency for the surrogate model assisted $(\mu/\mu,\lambda)$-ES. The strategy is evaluated numerically using a set of test functions. It shows that the step size adaptation mechanism adapted the step size successfully in all runs especially for a potential large population.

In future work, we will study the behaviour of surrogate assisted CMA-ES using the same analysis. Further goals include length scale adaptation mechanism in the Gaussian process. surrogate model accuracy control, and online surrogate models that could possibly further reduce the gap between expected analytical result and experimental result. 

% For future work, we will work on a selection mechanism for candidate solutions deciding what candidate solutions to choose based on the fitness gain it may bring. Further, a step size adaptation mechanism for the surrogate model assisted (1 + 1)-ES should be considered.

% hierarchical structure
% \textit{within} an Appendix, start with \textbf{subsection} as the
