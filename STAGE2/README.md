## STAGE 2
- Faster speed-up



### Schedule 
- 20181218
	- [] Normalized step size (what we can achieve, as upper bound)
	- [] If the opt. step size is independent of lambda
	- [] \*Can try weighted recombination but weights do not necessarily sum to 1 (ref Foundations_of_Genetic_Algorithms) 

### 1. Step size adaptation 

#### 1.1 Normalized step size 

Use fixed normalized step size to update step size.
